Project 4 from Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree by Google is the Musical Structure App.
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a MusicPlayer app. However, the original rubric did not require 
a working MediaPlayer. After successfully completing the course i went back and added the MediaPlayer functionality.
The original project was intended to demonstrate various ideas and skills learned through the course, including:
 - Use explicit Intents to link between activities in the app
 - Use OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java Code
 - Create my own Custom Class
 - Loop through an ArrayList
 - Populate a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
 *It now includes the additional functionality of playing music!
