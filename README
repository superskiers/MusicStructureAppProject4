Project 4 from Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree by Google is the Musical Structure App.
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a MusicPlayer app. 
For this project, the app does not actually need to play music. However, in combining various ideas
and skills learned through the course it must demonstrate the following:
 - Use explicit Intents to link between activities in the app
 - Use OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java Code
 - Create my own Custom Class
 - Loop through an ArrayList
 - Populate a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
